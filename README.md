# Dependency Injection Java

What is dependency injection and why is it used?

Dependency Injection creates instances of classes and passes it off to a class. It's used to help testing suites, extending applications, less boilerplate (DRY), and enable loose coupling for more extensible APIs. It's not a beginner level concept and the importance will be lost on programmers without experience in large codebases.

You can find 3 types of dependency injection examples in this repository.
