# Dependency Injection Java

What is dependency injection and why is it used?

Dependency Injection creates instances of classes and passes it off to a class. It's used to help testing suites, extending applications, less boilerplate (DRY), and enable loose coupling for more extensible APIs. It's not a beginner level concept and the importance will be lost on programmers without experience in large codebases.

You can find 3 types of dependency injection examples in this repository.

Constructor, property, or method injection implies where in the class that a
dependency (either a class instance, var, interface, etc.) is injected.

Always use a guard clause!!
